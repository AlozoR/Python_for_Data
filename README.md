# Python for Data
Data assignment

## We had to do:
* Understand the dataset, the features and the target
* Refactor it to visualize relations between the variables
* Apply some ML models to it to see if we can predict the target
* Implement the predictive model in a Flask app
* Summarize all the work in a slide presentation

## Conclusion
We learnt to work on a dataset in autonomy and real conditions.
Unluckily, some data were lacking in our dataset (data labeled as numbers
without any legend), so difficult to interpret, either for viz or predicting.
<br/>
Nevertheless, the dataset was rich enough to allow multiple visualizations
and predicting models.
